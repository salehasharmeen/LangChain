## Academic Paper Generator üìù

This project is an **academic paper generator** that utilizes a multi-agent system built with **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **LangSmith**. It can generate academic-style text based on a user's prompt.

### LangChain, LangGraph, and LangSmith: A Brief Overview

**LangChain** is a framework designed to streamline the creation of applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a modular structure for connecting LLMs with external data sources and other components, allowing you to build complex applications like chatbots, question-answering systems, and more. 

**LangGraph** is a specialized library built on top of LangChain. It helps in creating and managing multi-step, multi-agent workflows. It treats each step in the workflow as a node in a graph. This is particularly useful for building agents that need to perform a series of actions, make decisions, and interact with each other in a coordinated manner. 

**LangSmith** is a platform for debugging, testing, evaluating, and monitoring any LLM application built with LangChain. It provides a visual trace of the entire application's execution flow, making it easy to identify where issues are occurring, optimize performance, and ensure the quality of the generated outputs.

### Project Explanation: How It Works

This project creates a **multi-agent system** to generate academic content. The system consists of three main agents:

1.  **Search Agent**: This agent is responsible for searching the internet for relevant information. It takes the user's prompt and uses a search tool to find data and context related to the topic.
2.  **Planner Agent**: The planner agent analyzes the information gathered by the search agent and creates a structured outline for the academic paper. It determines the key sections and the flow of the content.
3.  **Writer Agent**: The writer agent takes the plan from the planner and the information from the search agent to write the actual academic paper, following the specified structure and integrating the gathered data.

The project uses **LangGraph** to orchestrate these agents, allowing them to communicate and work together in a sequence. The process is as follows:

1.  A user provides a prompt, for example, "Write an academic paper on the effect of climate change on biodiversity."
2.  The **Search Agent** performs a web search to find relevant articles and data. 
3.  The **Planner Agent** receives the search results and creates a detailed outline.
4.  The **Writer Agent** takes the outline and the original search data to draft the final paper.

The entire workflow is managed and can be traced using **LangSmith**. The notebook sets up the environment and runs the agents, and the results are then displayed in a **Streamlit** application, which provides a user-friendly interface. Below is an example of the output generated by the project.
